# Features

## Walkthrough Video Script

To record and share this config, I should make a video of doing some simple
tasks that touch many of my config's features.  It would go something like this:

1. I want to make some updates to my website, specifically the keyboard layout
   page.
1. Open website in Chrome.
   - Alternatively, use fzf chrome history shortcut
1. Open terminal to website dir
1. Talk about QTile's tiling, show different layouts
1. Start editing website in vim
   - Talk about neovim at a high level
   - Talk about one sentence per line formatting
   - Do some copy pasting and talk about clipboard manager, point it out in
     QTile bar
1. Now I want to preview my changes
1. Open new terminal with hugo command
   - Talk about command line completion and history searching
1. Use kitty kitten to open localhost url
1. Note that the workspace is getting crowded.
1. Send the hugo window to the '1a' workspace
1. Talk about my QTile workspace system
1. Go back to the split window with my local website and neovim
   - Talk about compton for transparency and for selective dimming of the
     usually mostly white chrome window 1.
1. Now talk about editing keyboard layouts at my special modifier keys (e.g.
   alt-h for backspace).

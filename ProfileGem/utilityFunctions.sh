# pg::decorated::f, *even if* subsequently f is redefined (e.g. during pgem_reload).

# that reference this string as decorations. This would allow pg::decorate to distinguish between
# still-decorated functions and redefined functions. Need to first convince myself this distinction
# is correct.

# Defines a stub function named $1 if no such command is installed. The stub
# will prompt the user to install the missing command. This isn't generally
# necessary, but can be helpful when the command is used indirectly by a
# function provided by a gem and you can provide more details than the shell's
# built in command-not-found message.
#
# For example, if a function depends on ag the gem could add the following to
# its command.sh to point users in the right direction:
#    pg::require ag 'Install via https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher'
#
# Once the command is installed the stub function removes itself.
pg::require() {
  local cmd="${1:?cmd}"
  local msg="${2:?msg}"

  # This early check might increase startup time, especially if a gem calls
  # pg::require many times. It might be better to remove it so the function
  # is always eval'ed - it will transparently remove itself upon being called.

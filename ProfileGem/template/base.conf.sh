# Default configuration file
#
# Specifies defaults for values to be set by the user's local config file, and
# is loaded before that file.  As these values can be overridden by the local
# config file and by other gems avoid setting environment variables and other
# global state here; instead define variables and defaults which environment.sh
# will then use after the user's config file has been loaded.
#
# Users are encouraged to update or override the values specified here.
